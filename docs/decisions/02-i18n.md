# Internationalization

## Context

It's important for the cognactive application and content to be made accessible to a global audience in different languages. This project started off with the i18next project in Vite SPA mode (without Remix). When migrating to Remix, I became more aware of certain issues with i18next in Remix, namely server and client side runtime performance. See [here](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/4548#discussioncomment-7807550).

One of the recommendations for Remix i18n was [Paraglide JS](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs#simple-adaptable-and-tiny-i18n-library-for-js). However it only works with Remix as a Vite plugin, which is not ready for production (yet).

## Decision

Skip localization and remove dynamic text for now.

## Consequences

Might need to refactor to Paraglide in future once Remix Vite is better supported.
