# Framework for Individual Health Empiricism

Author: [micksabox](https://x.com/micksabox)

Some medical mysteries can be difficult to debug. The modern information landscape is littered with advice and anecdotes, making it tough to sort through. As a programmer, I'm faced with finding creative solutions to solve hard technical problems on a daily basis. I often need to develop customized strategies to "debug" a problem. This article explains a framework for thinking about debugging medical problems when relating to personal health, and how the NAC protocol fits in.

## Empiricism

The idea that "trials" are needed is not new in medical literature. Dr. William Crook, the author of _The Yeast Connection: A Medical Breakthrough_ (published in 1983) called this a "therapeutic trial". This is especially useful when it comes to debugging _candida_(a yeast in the human microbiome), which is difficult to detect and is considered "commensal" (meaning everyone has it, so tests are skewed). Trying something and seeing if it works sometimes is the only way.

### Don't Trust. Verify

The blockchain and web3 movement has enshrined a well known mantra of "don't trust, verify" when discussing how to evaluate the source of truth for network level data. The network architecture of blockchains makes it easy to verify things like total currency supply, hash rate and other publicly broadcast metrics. Note the radical departure from the idea of "truth middlemen" which interpret and curate the primary information for you. My time exploring blockchain technology has instilled this mantra in me and setup my journey into the NAC supplement protocol, which I'll explain below.

### Individual Empiricism

Recently a [discussion on X by @levelsio](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1767023421676769708) regarding the elimination of bread from diet sparked my interest. One of the replies was:

> There also just needs to be more respect for “individual empiricism”. We all have incredibly unique bodies. The only way to know what works and doesn’t is to experiment on yourself [Scott Stevenson](https://twitter.com/scottastevenson/status/1767025859884728732)

So, what is empiricism? According to GPT4:

> Empiricism is a philosophical perspective that emphasizes the role of experience and evidence in the acquisition of knowledge. In simpler terms, it's the idea that all knowledge comes from and is tested by our experiences and sensory observations. This approach values empirical evidence, which is information acquired by observation or experimentation, over theoretical or abstract reasoning.

In the context of individual empiricism, it refers to a personal application of this principle, relying on one's own experiences and observations to understand and make decisions about the world. Like Scott mentioned above, there are decisions about our bodies and health that fall under this category.

## Evaluation Framework

When trying out any protocol to debug the body, I've thought of a way to evaluate the intervention according to certain dimensions and the principles of individual empiricism. Visually, try to picture a 3-dimensional chart:

1. X axis is verification difficulty
2. Y axis is safety
3. Z axis is benefits

With this 3D structure in mind, it might be easy to see where wellness interventions are preferred. The ideal should be to minimize the difficulty in verification and maximize safety and benefits. In simpler terms, getting more bang for buck while lowering risk and being able to verify yourself without relying on truth middlemen interpreters (as much as reasonably possible).

Within this evaluation framework I think the **NAC protocol is singular** and can demonstrate its appeal compared to other interventions. I go into more detail evaluating NAC protocol along each of these dimensions in the sections that follow.

## Dimension: Verification Difficulty

NAC protocol is relatively simple to self-verify in my opinion. This includes the ability to acquire the supplements (available over the counter) and the amount of time before results are observable. The NAC protocol regimen uses 3 over the counter supplements: Oregano oil, black seed oil, and NAC. Results are frequently seen in first week. My personal breakthroughs (less brain fog, fatigue, energy levels) were apparent within the first week with other similar anecdotes seen in the community. My mom reported better sleep, my wife reported "edge taken off” and both reported increased energy levels. These results are self-motivating to continue and complete the first phase (2-4 months typically).

Side note: this fast observability on NAC protocol can make it “sticky”, to borrow a term from the tech startup growth world. Once started, it makes sense that churning (stopping) is less likely if the person feels and sees positive benefits.

The full technical verification is a different matter which likely includes bio marker and other lab testing. This is part of verification that takes longer and requires patience, especially since the protocol is designed to work gently over time. Within the individual empiricism framework, “I’ve made these changes and started to feel better” is the verification that I’m referring to. There may be health conditions that disappear, taking verification to a personalized level.

## Dimension: Safety

**Obligatory disclaimer: make sure to consult your primary care provider before starting and nothing in this post should be considered medical advice.**

Individual empiricism requires safety considerations. The 3 supplements in NAC protocol are well studied in medical literature and in the case of black seed oil are have a long history. Oregano oil is plant based herbal medicine. NAC is a widely studied and popular amino acid supplement. So the amount of previous scientific literature, upon review, can contribute to evaluating how safe an intervention is, in my opinion.

In the spirit of individual empiricism, before I started NAC protocol I made sure to cross-reference the supplements with ChatGPT and articles I could find online. There’s lots of studies published in medical journals, and anecdotal evidence is littered across social media of people trying and seeing results with these supplements (both on their own and at combined level).

The NAC protocol whitepaper describes in more details some of the things to look out for. The protocol suggests probiotics to help complement gut health. Of course, the topic of safety is complex and so is the human body, so these few paragraphs on safety are by no means definitive.

There is a large and growing community that has been on the NAC protocol, in some cases for multiple years (on maintenance variations of it). The element of safety will be more understood over time. The NAC protocol was designed by a team of serious biomedical researchers including Seth Peribsen and M. MacLir. You can read the NAC protocol whitepaper [here](https://cognactive.net/files/NAC_Protocol.pdf).

## Dimension: Benefits

NAC protocol targets fungal pathogens in the human biome. Previously, these have been considered commensal (a natural, inseparable part of us) but recent research is changing this view. There are both first-order and second-order systemic effects at play, so this dimension is the most interesting and most technical.

Fungus species in biome like candida, cryptococcus and aspergillus contribute to a huge surface area of maladies. This is a well supported fact found in the medical literature. Long term colonization and overgrowth can remain undetected for years and I believe decades. There are large benefits to cutting the fung, it’s actually hard to believe (more on that below). That’s not to mention the symbiotic interactions with other bacteria and viruses (hint: they hide in biofilm substrate that fungus produces). Fungis role as part of overall immune system compromise is also a major component.

I can really only scratch the surface on benefits here to be honest. What I found helped my curriculum is previous literature on candida as a base layer, and then moving upwards to understanding systemic effects. It also was comforting for me to understand that candida has been identified in literature at least as far back as 1983 (41 years ago!). This is a sample of some of the books and the medical journal literature is easily discoverable.

## Note on Heuristics

It's important to note there exists cultured heuristics (rules of thumb) to be wary of miracle cures which I've encountered. One of them is to be cautious against miracle cures, to which I say:

**Miracle is relative.** Modern medicine would seem miraculous to people of the past lacking a sufficient explanation of mechanism of action. To someone knowledgeable about how a solution works mechanistically, it is less of a miracle and more within the realm of scientific explanation. Just because something seems like a miracle doesn't make it actually so.

Same goes for _"if it's too good to be true, it probably is"_. This heuristic is a double-edge sword, traditionally passed on as common sense caution to guard against charlatans and risky scenarios. Fair enough. But it can also prevent the earnest exploration of things that do seem like miracles to the uninitiated.

In either case, the framework of individual empiricism rejects the notion of truth middlemen towards self-verification, so the use of heuristics may not be as relevant in this paradigm.

## Bonus Dimension: Simplicity / Complexity

This dimension deserves special mention. The heavy lifting behind the NAC protocol occurs in the theory of fungal pathogens at a systemic level. Full credit to the NAC protocol creators and more power to them. The supplement and diet protocols do the work, but the systemic interactions behind the theory are where elegant simplicity shines through.

## **🌎🧑🏼‍🚀🔫🧑🏼‍🚀 Wait, it's the fungi? Always has been.**

Compare the simple few-step supplement NAC protocol against Bryan Johnsons Blueprint, which involves a laundry list of supplements and techniques to decrease aging. In my opinion, this is a more difficult road as each supplement may increase the dimensions of verification difficulty, safety and benefits towards undesirable equilibria.

I hope this framework of individual health empiricism is useful to somebody who is struggling with the challenge of navigating the waters of personal health, either for themselves or their loved ones.
