> The fungi non-human intelligence and humanity have been in a cold war. And until the early 2020s, humanity was losing.

That sounds like the fictional opening to a movie or a video game. Sometimes reality is indeed stranger than fiction. I think there is an interesting potential for merging of the fungal epidemic reality with fiction and gaming elements towards the goals of driving personal health education for the betterment of humanity. Here are some reasons to wrap the cognactive experience as a type of game:

## Mass Appeal

An experience that is formatted as a game appeals to a wide audience already familiar with gaming. From Super Mario all the way to Fortnite, this large segment (likely majority) of the population includes entire generations that literally grew up playing games.

The gamification is likely to render as a visual wrapper around content and interactive experiences that is symbiotic with the subject matter. This means in terms of practical difficulty, the decision to gamify cognactive shouldn't make the experience less accessible or unappealing to non-gaming audiences.

## Open World with Room to Grow

Games can be mediums for rich storytelling and interactive experiences. A game format offers the freedom for contributions of different kinds, and a single, consistent user interface paradigm to accomodate all of them under one roof. For example, scientific contributions (papers, experiment results, etc) can be part of the "Research Lab". Contributions of history and lore can be part of the "Library". Software and technology can be part of the "Machinery". Even topics as esoteric as remote viewing can be part of in-game lore. The richness and diversity of this game world is only limited by imagination.

## Engagement Driver

Every additional incentive matters when considering compliance to any sort of regimen, especially one tied into deeply rooted routines like diet. By packaging cognactive as a game, the experience becomes more engaging and even fun. For example, the dietary changes recommended by the NAC protocol can be assisted with food guides which are engaging and use the latest artificial intelligence technology.

In games, players can follow routines, interact with tools and NPCs, share tips and strategies, form communities and social connections. These type of interactions seem to already happen organically and so wrapping them in a game format could be considered an extension of existing behaviour. Rather than forcing players to swim upstream, the game format is likely to enhance the overall experience.

## Risks

Packaging cognactive as a game might also introduce some risks.

- Potential confusion about integration of game, fiction and real-life. To mitigate this, strategies to clarify boundaries could be developed and used to avoid confusion, misunderstandings and misuse.
