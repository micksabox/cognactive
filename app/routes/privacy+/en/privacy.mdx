# Cognactive Privacy & Data Usage Policy

Last Updated: 2025-01-27

Sovilon Software Inc ("we," "us," or "our"), registered in Canada, operates the Cognactive application ("Service") globally. This policy outlines how we handle personal and non-personal data when you use our Service, regardless of your location, and explains your rights regarding this data.

## Information Collection And Use

We do not collect any personally identifying information (PII) from users of our Service, in compliance with international privacy regulations including GDPR (European Union), CCPA (California, USA), PIPEDA (Canada), and other applicable laws.

## Data Collected:

**Regimen Tracking Information:** We collect data related to important dates for regimen habit tracking activities (start date, phase transition dates), regimen activities like supplements, notes, and observed experiences. This data is stored locally on your device using browser local storage technology and is not transmitted to or stored on any server owned or operated by us or third parties. This approach ensures data privacy regardless of your geographical location.

**Camera Photos:** We relay photos for features related to computer vision assisted workflows, including but not limited to ingredient scanning. The photos are transmitted from the Cognactive application through servers located in Canada and the United States, then forwarded directly to upstream computer vision API providers without persistent storage on our infrastructure. For detailed information about data handling practices, please refer to the privacy policies of our API providers.

Our primary computer vision API provider is OpenAI (United States), whose policy explicitly states they do not save or train their models on data submitted via their API.

## Use of Data

The data collected by the Cognactive app is used exclusively to enable your regimen tracking activities within the app. We maintain a strict no-sharing policy - your data is not shared with third parties for any purpose, regardless of jurisdiction.

## Data Management

Users worldwide can exercise their right to data control by resetting their activity tracker within the Cognactive app, which permanently removes all locally saved data.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in global privacy regulations or our practices. We will notify you of any changes by posting an updated policy at this webpage. We recommend reviewing this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed of any updates.
