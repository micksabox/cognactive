## Crossing the blood brain barrier

Fungi can access the central nervous system (CNS) by crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through a few key mechanisms:

Transcellular penetration: Fungi like Cryptococcus neoformans can actively invade and penetrate through brain endothelial cells to cross the BBB. This involves interactions between fungal surface proteins and receptors on the endothelial cells. [2](#2),[3](#3).

Paracellular migration: Fungi like Candida albicans may also be able to cross the BBB through the spaces between endothelial cells, by degrading tight junction proteins like E-cadherin. [1](#1)

Trojan horse mechanism: Fungi can also use immune cells like monocytes to "hitch a ride" across the BBB, a process known as the Trojan horse mechanism. [2](#2)
